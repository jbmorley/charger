## Cutting

- Small router bit 1/8"

1. Mount the material and level it
2. 



### Preparing the bed

- Home machine
- Reset XY origin to 500, 500
- Bed zero at top
- Material thickness 12mm
- Start 0mm
- Cut depth 10mm
- bed-mounting-holes-zero-top.tap

### Top

- Cut the pillar holes (full material depth + 0.5mm)
- Cut away the outer material
- Cut the inner recess (note that in the future this could be cut 1mm higher) 10.5mm (start at top + 10.5mm and cut a depth of 1mm)???

13.0 = level to starting thickness



- Cut the outer profile, after securing the wood with screws
- Cut the recess for the perspex panel / top plate recess (this needs to go to a depth of 10.5, so it's a start of 13-11.5=1.5mm and a depth of 1.0)
- Coil Pocket: start = 13.0-11.5+1.0 = 2.5mm, depth = 4.5mm
- Puck Pocket: start = 13.0-11.5+1.0 = 2.5mm, depth = 6mm

### Bottom

- Plate Pocket: start = 13.0-11.5 = 1.5, depth = 1.0mm
- PCB Pocket: start = 13.0-11.5+1.0 = 2.5, depth = 5.0mm
- Cable Pocket: start = 13.0-11.5+1.0+5.0 = 7.5mm, depth = 2.5mm
- Puck Cable Pocket: start = 13.0-11.5+1.0+5.0 = 7.5mm, depth = 3.5mm
- USB Board Pocket: start = 13.0-11.5+1.0 = 2.5, depth = 3.5mm
- USB Socket Pocket: start = 13.0-11.5+1.0+3.5 = 6mm, depth = 3.5mm

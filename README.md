## Qi Charger PCB Mounting

### Bolts (Nylon) x 4

| Feature         | Calculation (mm) | Size (mm) |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Head Diameter	  | 6.0              |           |
| Head Depth      | 2.0              |           |
| Thread Diameter | 3.0              |           |
| Thread Length   | 2.5 + 5.0        |           |


### Nuts (Nylon) x 4

| Feature         | Calculation (mm) | Size (mm) |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Thread Diameter | 3.0              |           |
| Depth           | 2.0              |           |

## USB-C PCB Mounting

### Bolts (Nylon) x 4

| Feature         | Calculation (mm) | Size (mm) |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Head Diameter | 5.0             |           |
| Head Depth   | 2.0        |           |
| Thread Diameter           | 3.0              |           |
| Thread Length           | 4.0 + 3.5              |           |

_N.B. The thread diameter here seems off; I don’t believe these are M3 boards. Either that, or the measurements on the Qi charger PCBs are off._

_No washers are required as the board needs to sit flush with the case to ensure the USB-C port aligns correctly._

## Case Mounting

### Bolts (Brass) x 4

| Feature         | Calculation (mm) | Size (mm) |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Head Diameter   | 6.0              |           |
| Head Depth      | 4.0              |           |
| Thread Diameter | 3.0              |           |
| Thread Length   | 13.5 + 1.0 + 4.0 | 18.0      |

_Trying with a 16.0 mm screw in the first instance._
